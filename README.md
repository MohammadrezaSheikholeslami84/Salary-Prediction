# Salary Prediction Using Adult Income Dataset

This project uses the **Adult Income Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) to build a model that predicts whether a person earns more than \$50K per year based on demographic and economic features.

## üìÅ Files

- `Salary-Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the code and analysis for this project.
- `Code-Report.pdf`: Project overview and explanation.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset includes the following:
- A training set (`adult.data`)
- A test set (`adult.test`)

### Features include:
- Age
- Workclass
- Education and Education-Num
- Marital Status
- Occupation
- Relationship
- Race
- Sex
- Capital Gain / Loss
- Hours per Week
- Native Country
- Income (target variable)

## üß™ Project Steps

1. **Load Libraries**: Import essential Python packages like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
2. **Data Loading**: Download and load both training and test sets from the UCI repository.
3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values represented as `'?'`
   - Clean test set labels (e.g., removing trailing `.` in income classes)
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize feature distributions
   - Understand correlations and feature-target relationships
5. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize/standardize features if needed
6. **Modeling**:
   - Train models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, XGBoost, SVM, Random Forests, and MLP
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV** to optimize model parameters
   - Improve model generalization and performance
   - Example tuned parameters:
     - `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `n_estimators` for tree-based models
     - `C`, `penalty` for logistic regression
   - Use **cross-validation** to prevent overfitting
   - 
8. **Model Comparison**:  
   - Compare the performance of different algorithms.  
   - Select the best model based on balanced metrics.
